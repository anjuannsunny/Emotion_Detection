- **Image Preview:** View the uploaded or captured image along with the detected emotion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Bootstrap 4.5:** For responsive design and UI components.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions and image processing.
- **Fetch API:** For making network requests to the server.
- **FileReader API:** For reading image files on the client side.
- **WebRTC:** For accessing the camera.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection-system.git
    cd emotion-detection-system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Ensure you have a web server set up to serve the static files and handle POST requests. For example, you can use Flask or another web framework. Install the required dependencies as per your project's requirements.

3. **Run the Server:**

    Set up and start your server. For example, if using Flask:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the Application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or the address configured for your server).

## Usage

    - Click the "Capture Image" button to take a photo.
    - The captured image will be displayed in a new modal along with the predicted emotion.

## Code Explanation

- **HTML Structure:** The `index.html` file contains the structure of the web application, including modals for image preview and camera capture.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** The script handles user interactions, such as uploading an image, starting the camera, capturing an image, and displaying results.
